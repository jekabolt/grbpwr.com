## CONDITIONS FOR RETURNS AND EXCHANGES

GRBPWR (“we”, “us”, “our”) accepts returns or exchanges for eligible products within 14 calendar days of receipt. Products must be returned in their original, unused condition, with all original packaging, tags, labels, and any included accessories or documentation.
Items that are damaged, worn, altered, incomplete, or returned without tags and original packaging will not be accepted and will be sent back to the customer.
Exchanges are allowed for the same item in a different size or colour (if available). If you wish to receive a different product or variation (e.g. different style or material), you must return the original item for a refund and place a new order separately.
Please note: Personalised or made-to-order products, or any items clearly marked as “non-returnable” at the time of purchase, cannot be returned in accordance with applicable law.
This policy does not affect your statutory rights regarding defective or misdescribed items.

## HOW TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE A PRODUCT

To initiate a return or exchange, please use the returns form included in your original package. If the form is missing, contact our customer service team.
Once your request is submitted, you’ll receive an email confirmation along with a return shipping label. Please follow these steps:

- Carefully repackage the item(s) in their original condition, using the original packaging wherever possible.
- Affix the return label over the original label and seal the parcel securely.
- Arrange collection via the courier’s website or drop the parcel off at a designated drop-off point.
  Alternatively, return your online purchase to any GRBPWR store within the United Kingdom (excluding concessions and department stores).
  Returns must be sent back within 14 calendar days of submitting your return or exchange request.

## REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES

Once we receive your returned item, it will be inspected to confirm that it meets our return conditions. If approved, your refund or exchange will be processed.
Refunds are issued to the original payment method and in the same currency used for the purchase. Refunds for orders paid via cash on delivery will be processed via bank transfer.

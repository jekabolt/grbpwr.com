## INTRODUCTION

These General Terms and Conditions of Sale ("Terms") govern the purchase of products ("Products") through the GRBPWR website ("Website"). By placing an order, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Website Terms of Use. If you do not agree, you may not place an order.
Orders may only be placed by individual consumers purchasing for personal use and not for resale. If you are under the legal age of majority, you must have permission from a parent or guardian before placing an order.
We may update these Terms from time to time. The version applicable to your order is the one in effect at the time you confirm your purchase.

## PRODUCT INFORMATION

Product details, including prices, are available on the Website. Images are for reference only and may not exactly reflect the item received. Please rely on the written product descriptions when making your selection.
We reserve the right to limit quantities per order and per customer. Adding an item to your cart does not reserve it.

## PRICES AND TAXES

Prices are listed in EUR and include applicable VAT or sales taxes. Delivery costs and any additional charges are shown at checkout. For international orders, customs duties and import taxes may apply and are either pre-paid or your responsibility depending on the destination country.
If an item is mistakenly priced, we reserve the right to cancel your order and inform you accordingly.

## PLACING AN ORDER

To place an order, follow the steps outlined on the Website, including selecting your items, entering shipping and payment details, and confirming your acceptance of these Terms. You’ll have a chance to review and amend your order before final submission.
After submitting your order, you’ll receive an email confirmation. This confirmation does not constitute acceptance of your order. The order is only considered accepted once we notify you that your items have shipped.

## PAYMENT

We accept major credit and debit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Klarna, and other options as listed on the Website. All payments are securely processed via Stripe. Your card will not be charged until the order has shipped.
In case your payment is declined, the order will be cancelled. You are responsible for any fees applied by your bank or payment provider.
An electronic invoice will be sent to the email address provided at checkout.

## PRE-ORDERS

From time to time, we may offer the option to pre-order items before their release. Payment is only processed when the item is ready to ship. The expected shipping date will be shown on the product page.

## DELIVERY

Delivery is carried out by our courier partners and typically occurs within 5-7 business days, excluding weekends and public holidays. Pre-order items are shipped once available.
You’ll receive tracking details via email once your order is dispatched. Please ensure that your delivery information is accurate. We are not responsible for delays due to incorrect addresses or force majeure events.

## RISK AND TITLE

Risk passes to you upon delivery or collection. Products remain our property until full payment is received.

## RETURNS AND RIGHT TO CANCEL

You may return items within 14 days of receiving them, using the return form provided in your package. Items must be unused, in their original condition and packaging, with all labels and accessories included. Products that are damaged, worn, or missing tags will not be accepted.
Returns are free of charge when using our prepaid return label. Refunds are processed within 5–7 days after we receive and approve your return and are issued to the original payment method.
Some items ( such as personalised or non-returnable products) cannot be returned. This does not affect your statutory rights.

## EXCHANGES

You may exchange items within 14 days of delivery, subject to availability, for the same product in a different size or colour. For other changes, please return your item and place a new order.

## DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS

If your item arrives damaged or defective, please contact our support team immediately with photos and a description. We’ll either repair, replace, or refund the item at no cost to you.

## LIABILITY

Nothing in these Terms excludes our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.
We are not responsible for indirect or unforeseeable losses, or for issues arising from your use of the Website beyond our control.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All trademarks, logos, designs, and product imagery remain the property of GRBPWR or its licensors. Reproduction or misuse is prohibited without written permission.

## PROMOTIONS

Promotional offers are valid for the dates and terms stated on the Website. Discounts cannot be combined with other offers. We may withdraw or cancel promotions at our discretion.

## GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

These Terms are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, regardless of the country of delivery. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales, without affecting your statutory rights to bring a claim in the courts of your place of residence if required by applicable consumer protection laws.
